# Orbitool
This is an application for calculating satellite orbital parameters. Built with Python (Kivy) 
Its functions include; calculation of apogee, perigee, semi minor axis, semi major axis and so on. These parameters are important to achieve optimum orbital travel of a satellite and to estimate it's position at any given time. It runs on Kivy, a framwork in Python.

Kivy is an open-source Python library for development of cross platform applications that make use of innovative user interfaces, thus allowing you run the same code on all supported platforms
